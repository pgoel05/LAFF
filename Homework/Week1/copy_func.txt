DESCRIPTION

Copies vector x into vector y

Vectors x and y can be a mixture of column and/or row vector.  In other words, x and y can be n x 1 or 1 x n arrays. However, one size must equal 1 and the other size equal n.

The reason y is an input parameter is that the input y indicates whether the output, y_out, is a column or row vector, and then also indicates whether x must be transposed (e.g., if x is a row vector and y is a column vector).

x and y must each be either an n X 1 array (column vector) or a 1 X n array (row vector).

 y_out must be the same kind of vector as y.

The function should “transpose” the vector if x and y do not have same “shape”.

If x and/or y are not vectors or if the size of vector x doesn’t match the size of vector y, the output should be “FAILED”.

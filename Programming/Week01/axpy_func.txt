DESCRIPTION

The function that computes ax+y given scalar a and vectors x and y.

x and y must each be either a nx1 array (column vector) or a 1xn array (row vector)

y_out must be the same kind of vector as y.

If x and/or y are not vectors or if the size of (row or column) vector x does not match the size of (row or column) vector y, the output should be 'FAILED'.

If a is not a scalar, the output should be 'FAILED'.
